#Key Features:
#Content-Based Recommendations: Utilizes textual data to assess similarities between movies.
#User-Friendly Interface: Simple function calls allow users to easily retrieve recommendations.
#Comprehensive Dataset: Combines multiple data points from TMDB to enhance recommendation accuracy.
#Efficient Storage: Processed data and similarity metrics are saved in .pkl files for quick access.
#This project aims to provide an engaging and personalized movie-watching experience by leveraging data-driven insights.
